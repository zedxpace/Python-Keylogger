# BlackHatPython-Keylogger

# Code is explained in the following link : https://codexpace.blogspot.com/2021/11/python-keylogger.html

[python -3.7]
- You just have to run the code and keep in mind the file named keylogs 
  and the code must be in same project so that all the captured data   
  can be stored in the keylogs.txt rather then viewing it on terminal .
- Note : 
        running the code for second time will not erase your previously captured keystroke 
        it will just append the logs rather then overwriting them 
- Before running the code make sure that you have all the modules installed in your system.
- ABout Keylogger :
- please store the keylogs.txt in same directory as code where all the keylogs will saved
- you just need to start the keylogger once you started it will automatically capture each and every stroke so ,
even it is mozilla or chrome or any other application.
